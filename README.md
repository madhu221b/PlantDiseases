The research paper used to create this image classifier was Mohanty Sharada P., Hughes David P., Salathé Marcel,” Using Deep Learning for Image-Based Plant Disease Detection”, Frontiers in Plant Science, Volume 7, 2016.

The dataset was obtained from crowdAI's PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge.Hereis the link for the same: https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/plantvillage-disease-classification-challenge/dataset_files


The segmentation of images was done using the script provided: test_2.py
Training accuracy obtained was 97.03%
Classfication was done in this case among only 4 classes instead of 38.
The segmentation first consists of masking the background pixels and then the green pixel values.
